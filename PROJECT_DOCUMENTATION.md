- Inline styles are also used in some HTML files for specific sections.

- **script.js**: Manages navigation toggling, popups, and modal dialogs for offers and product details.

---

## Assets
- **img/**: Contains product images (e.g., sweets, barfi, kaju katli).
- **img1/**: Contains UI assets (e.g., backgrounds, SVGs).

---

## Markdown Files
- **index.md, read.md, swwet.md**: Contain either commented-out HTML or full HTML copies of the main pages, possibly for documentation or backup.

---

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the main site.
2. Use `admin-login.html` to access the admin dashboard (credentials logic not included in the code provided).
3. Navigate to `sweets.html` for the product showcase.
4. Visit `mysudhamrit-privacy-policy.html` for privacy information.

## Customization
- Update images in the `img/` and `img1/` folders for new products or branding.
- Edit `style.css` for color, font, or layout changes.
- Modify `script.js` and `main.js` to add or change interactivity.

- Admin features are UI-only unless connected to a backend.
